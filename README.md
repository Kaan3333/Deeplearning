# üñºÔ∏è CIFAR-10 Image Classification

This project explores two distinct deep learning approaches for image classification on the **CIFAR-10 dataset**: building a custom **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** from scratch and using **transfer learning** with a pre-trained model.

The main objective is to compare the performance and practical trade-offs of these two methods.

## üöÄ Methodology

### 1. Custom CNN

A CNN was designed from the ground up to handle the 32x32 color images of the CIFAR-10 dataset.

- **Data Preprocessing:** Images were normalized to a standard range to optimize model training.
- **Architecture:** The model features multiple layers of convolutions, pooling, and fully connected layers.
- **Training:** The model was trained using the Adam optimizer with cross-entropy loss. **Early stopping** was implemented to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.

### 2. Transfer Learning

For this approach, a powerful, pre-trained model was leveraged to achieve superior results with less training time.

- **Pre-trained Model:** The **ResNet-50** model, which was pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, was chosen for this task.
- **Adaptation:** The final classification layer of ResNet-50 was replaced with a new layer tailored for the 10 classes of CIFAR-10. The original ResNet-50 layers were frozen to retain their learned features, and only the new layer was trained.

## üìä Results & Performance Comparison

The two models were evaluated on a validation set, and their performance was compared using accuracy as the primary metric.

| Model | Accuracy |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Custom CNN** | ~75% |
| **Transfer Learning (ResNet-50)** | ~93% |

**Key Finding:** The transfer learning approach significantly outperformed the custom-built CNN. This demonstrates that using a pre-trained model is a highly effective strategy, especially for tasks with limited data, as it leverages vast amounts of knowledge from a larger, more general dataset.

### Advantages of Transfer Learning

- **Higher Accuracy:** Achieves better performance by utilizing robust features learned from a massive dataset.
- **Faster Convergence:** Requires less training time and data to reach a high level of performance.
- **Efficiency:** Drastically reduces the computational resources needed for training a high-performing model.
